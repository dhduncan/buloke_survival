# Buloke survival
This repository contains code and data, being supplementary information to Bennett et al (in prep). The cited manuscript describes a field experiment on survival of 1275 hand planted buloke (*Allocasuarina luehmannii*) seedlings in Wyperfeld National Park, Victoria, Australia.

The easiest way to interact with this content is by launching the .Rproj file in an RStudio session, so that viewers for the *Access_data_and_reproduce_models.html* content are readily available.

The html file should guide a user through the analysis as presented in the manuscript, and implemented in `R`. The data objects for mortality and browse outcomes are presented as .Rda files accessible from `R`. 

This research received funding from the Australian Governmentâ€™s National Environmental Science Program through the

, and Parks Victoria.
